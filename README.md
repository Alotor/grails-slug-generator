=====================

This plugin generate unique slugs for String properties. Its main use case is to generate unique an "nice" urls for access to domain objects.

For example, instead of access to a user profile by id http://www.domain.com/user/25 you can generate an unique url based in the user name: http://www.domain.com/user/ivan-lopez (in case the user name is Iván López).
